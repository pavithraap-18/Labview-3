# Labview-3
basic operations in labview
The LabVIEW simulations successfully demonstrated various signal processing techniques, including 
waveform generation, noise analysis, and filtering. A Virtual Instrument (VI) was developed to generate 
and add two sine waves with frequencies of 100Hz and 200Hz, displaying the combined output on both a 
graph and a chart. The effect of Gaussian noise was then examined by inserting a noise block and analyzing 
its Fourier Transform (FFT). To mitigate noise effects, a 4th-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 200Hz 
cutoff frequency was applied, and the filtered signalâ€™s FFT was compared with the original. Additionally, 
a 200Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 2 was transmitted through an Additive White Gaussian Noise 
(AWGN) channel with different noise levels (standard deviations of 0.1, 1, and 2), and its spectrum was 
analyzed. The experiments effectively demonstrated the impact of noise on signal clarity and the role of 
filtering in improving signal quality.
